# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis-for-Fatality-Risk-Reduction

🚦 Road Accident Data Analysis for Fatality Risk Reduction
📌 Project Overview

Road accidents pose a serious public safety challenge, resulting in significant loss of life and economic impact.
This project analyzes road accident and vehicle-level data to identify high-risk factors contributing to fatal accidents and generate actionable insights that can support fatality risk reduction and road safety planning.

The analysis is performed using SQL, simulating a real-world analytics use case relevant to government agencies, traffic authorities, and insurance companies.

🎯 Objectives

- Analyze road accident data to understand fatal vs non-fatal accident patterns.

- Identify high-risk factors contributing to accident fatalities.

- Assess the impact of vehicle types and accident severity.

- Support data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

- SQL – Data querying, joins, aggregations, Window functions, Subquery, CTEs.

- CSV Files – Accident and vehicle datasets.

- Relational Data Analysis – Structured querying and insights extraction.

📊 Key Analysis Performed

Question 1: How many accidents have occurred in urban areas versus rural areas?
Question 2: Which day of the week has the highest number of accidents?
Question 3: What is the average age of vehicles involved in accidents based on their type?
Question 4: Can we identify any trends in accidents based on the age of the vehicles involved?
Question 5: Are there any specific weather conditions that contribute to severe accidents?
Question 6: Do accidents often involve impacts on the left-hand side of vehicles?
Question 7: Are there any relationships between journey purposes and the severity of accidents?
Question 8: Calculate the average age of vehicles involved in accidents, considering daylight and point of impact

🔍 Key Insights

- Fatal accidents are significantly influenced by accident severity.

- Certain vehicle types contribute disproportionately to fatal outcomes.

- Clear patterns exist that can help prioritize risk reduction strategies.

- Data-driven insights can guide policy and enforcement decisions.
 (Insights derived from structured SQL analysis on real-world-style datasets)

🧠 Business Value

- Enables identification of high-risk accident factors.

- Supports road safety and fatality prevention initiatives.

- Useful for insurance risk analysis and public safety planning.

- Demonstrates strong SQL-based analytical problem-solving skills.

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL-driven data analysis can uncover meaningful insights into road accident fatalities and support fatality risk reduction strategies.
It reflects a practical analytics workflow focused on impact, clarity, and real-world decision-making.
